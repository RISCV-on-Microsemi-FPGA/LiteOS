## Microsemi RISC-V port for Huawei LiteOS

### LiteOS
The LiteOS is available at: [LiteOS_Kernel](https://github.com/LITEOS/LiteOS_Kernel)

    
### Test Platform and FPGA design:
M2S150-Advanced-Dev-Kit
[SmartFusion2 Advanced Development Kit RISC-V Sample Design](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/M2S150-Advanced-Dev-Kit/blob/master/Programming_The_Target_Device/PROC_SUBSYSTEM_BaseDesign)   

### LiteOS Port Test results:
    LOS_BoadExampleEntry    -- executes on board.
    LOS_Inspect_Entry       -- Following tests are passed.
        LOS_INSPECT_TASK
        LOS_INSPECT_EVENT
        LOS_INSPECT_MSG
        LOS_INSPECT_SEM
        LOS_INSPECT_MUTEX
        LOS_INSPECT_SYSTIC
        LOS_INSPECT_TIMER
        LOS_INSPECT_LIST
        LOS_INSPECT_SMEM
        LOS_INSPECT_DMEM

### How to run the LiteOS RISC-V port:
Open SoftConsole IDE and import the project riscv-liteos-port into SoftConsole. 
Buld the project and DownLoad it from SoftConsole to M2S150-Advanced-Dev-Kit using FlashPro Debugger.

The miv-rv32im-liteos-port-test is a self contained project where only those LiteOS components 
which are related to RISC-V port are part of the project.
    
This example project requires USB-UART interface to be connected to a host PC. 
The host PC must connect to the serial port using a terminal emulator such as 
TeraTerm or PuTTY configured as follows:
    
        - 115200 baud
        - 8 data bits
        - 1 stop bit
        - no parity
        - no flow control
    
The platform/M2S150_RV32/hw_platform.h file contains the design related information
that is required for this project. If you update the design, the hw_platform.h 
must be updated accordingly.
    
The preprocessor LOS_M2S150_RV32 must be defined for this project.
